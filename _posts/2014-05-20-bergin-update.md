title: Bergin Update

The Bergin site is getting very close to going live. We are projecting everything being ready for live testing on June 6th.

#Quick Update

Bergin requested serveral final updates last week. Ben is finishing those updates now but they require core updates to xTuple. This means that Bergin will require 4.5 in order to hook up the eComm site to the ERP. 

#What's left

Search is the main thing that is left to be finished. Andrey is wrapping up a few small things, but at this point the clients list of requirements have been met with the exception of search.

#The Plan

Currently the plan is to finish the search functionality and Andrey's small tasks. Steve's team is on schedule to have their ERP on 4.5 by June 6th. At that point we will connect the eComm system to the 4.5 ERP. 

Live testing will begin at that point.

Currently we need to gather a list of "Go Live Business Logic" tasks. These are things like:

- Updating the content of system automated emails
- Migrating any required content
- Updating email invoice content
- Updating any error pages or error messages to be Bergin friendly (aka - "Sorry, but you don't have credit. Please call 1-800...")
