title: K&H Update
---

The K&H site is very close to being wrapped up. The final pieces are:

- **Credit Card Processing** via Authorize.net
- **Shipping integration** - They are using a standard FedEx module for 90% of their shipping. However, K&H does offer their own shipping service for specific circumstances. We are developing an if/then statment that will flag these types of orders and K&H staff will handle shipping manually on these orders.
- **Theming** - the eCommerce site is to match the Drupal marketing site that we built for them in the Fall
- **Taxes** - we need to integrate a tax solution however at this time John has explained that we can't simply push taxes into the ERP

We are shooting for an early June launch
