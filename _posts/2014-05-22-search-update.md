title: Search Update
---
We now have a plan in place for moving forward with search. The details are outlined below:

###Current Plan
1. To help finish Bergin and K&H we are going to use Drupal search modules that are suffienct to the clients needs. 
1. Eventually we want to think through the best way possible to offer search solutions to clients. However, we are going to save that conversation for after Bergin and K&H are live.
2. These specific search solutions will not become part of the eComm product at this time. We want to make final decisions about the best way to handle search, then implement those solutions into the eComm product.

###Long term
We need to define how our customers customers will be using search on their websites. There are many things to think about like the following:

1. Will search results include more than products?
1. Will search be faceted or simply based on keywords?
1. Will the client need a mixture of filtering and search?
1. Will user's be able to have advanced search options? (search, but only these topics).
1. Will user's be able to search documents? (search past invoices)

We need to define these needs, and develop a solution that is flexible enough to solve each of these issues.
