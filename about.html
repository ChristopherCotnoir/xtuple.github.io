  <h1 class="page-title">On-Going To Do List</h1>

<p>This is an on-going To Do list for the xTupleCommerce Product. Obviously there is a lot of work that needs to be done to make this product better. This list represents those things that need to be done as well as presenting the priority of these items. If you feel that anything is missing from this list, please <a href="mailto:jfischer@xtuple.com">email me</a> to let me know.</p>

<h2>High Priority (in this order)</h2>

<ul>
<li>Search - Simple Solr Search. Not faceted search at this point</li>
<li>Estimated Shipping - show estimated shipping from a FedEx Drupal Module integration</li>
<li>Spec (or other doc links) displayed on detail page - add a "Download" CTA to the Product description page. This will download the association PDF to the users machine.</li>
<li>In the ERP, color code the sales orders. E.g. Make Internet sales blue and ERP sales orders red, etc.</li>
<li>Show multiple photos on the product description page. Allow the user to "slide" or click through the images without refreshing the page.</li>
<li>Anonymous users can make a purchase. When they make a order their account informatin is saved to the ERP.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Request requires a team conversations</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tax</li>
<li>Rep information - Ned had this figured out. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Lower priority</h2>
<ul>
<li>Categories - When you click on a Parent Category, show all the products in that category and the children category</li>
<li>Clean up the User Profile Page</li>
<li>Turn on AddThis (Drupal) and apply to the products</li>
<li>Turn on SEO Features (Drupal)</li>
<li>Add a Help Section (for Sales guys. Include log in information, Videos)</li>
<li>Multiple payment gateways (Stripe, Authorize.net, USAePay)</li>
<li>Order Favorites - This functionality is on Bergin. Need to update this functionality on the Prodiem Site.</li>
<li> ~~Migrate Blog, Testimonials content~~ </li>
</ul>

<h2>Guest Purchasers</h2>
<ul>
<li>Force the user to login/register when they click the "Checkout"
button in the cart</li>
<li>Allow anonymous checkout. This requires that we have some customer
to push the orders in to during checkout. There will need to be a
catchall "Anonymous" Customer in xTuple for us to use. We also have to
add some logic to hide the whole "Add existing" features so the
checkout forms are just blank a Contact and Address for Ship To and
Billing.</li>
</ul>
